## Course Description

This course will introduce students to the components involved in writing a research
paper in economics or other quantitative disciplines, by spending the semester having
them writing such a paper. Early in the semester, each student will pick a topic for
their paper, which will consist just of a brief description of the question (probably
a topic they have studied in a previous course). As the semester progresses, the
student will learn how to flesh out this germ of a topic into a full-length paper
using many of the internet and other tools that are used by scholars in their own
research. These include tools for exploring a topic (Google Scholar; ChatGPT; Wikipedia);
compiling a bibliography of references to your subject (LitMaps; PaperPile); creating a
document with appropriate content (Jupyter notebooks); project management and
collaboration via GitHub; generation and incorporation of figures and tables;
and the preparation of slide presentations. This will be a hands-on course: Students
will bring their laptops to the lecture and the use of the tools will be taught live
and interactively. Writing assignments will take the form of Jupyter notebooks (or,
for any graduate student enrollees, LaTeX documents).

## Course Requirements

Recommended Course Background: some familiarity with python or other modern programming
languages (though having taken a formal course in such a language is not required).

This course is split into five main phases:
- the setup: students will get set up with all of the tools necessary
  for writing a research paper in a quantitative discipline
- the pitch: students will craft a compelling, challenging research
  pitch for their term paper
- the draft: students will learn about and explore common tools
  for research paper writing as they prepare the draft for their term paper
- the submission: students will get direct feedback for completing
  their term paper and readying it for publication or submission to a journal
- the presentation: students will craft a compelling presentation detailing
  the research done in process of writing their term paper

Note that the schedule above may shift as we progress through the course. Updates to due dates will be communicated to you by your instructor or TA.

**This is a live document. Please refresh this page periodically to check for updates.**

## Grading

Your grade in this course will consist of four components:
- Research pitch (10%—due Mon Sep 25)
- Term paper:
    - Draft submission (25%—due Fri Oct. 27th)
    - Final submission (25%—due Fri Dec. 1st)
- Research presentation (10%—due Mon Dec 4)
- Course participation (30%—assessed overall)

The last component (“course participation”) will be assessed by your instructor and TA based on the following factors:
- course attendance
- participation in course discussions
- regular check-ins & incremental deliverables (as directed by your TA)

## Policies

The below is a non-exclusive list of policies governing course procedure.

If you have any questions or concerns, it is your responsibility to promptly
bring them to the attention of the course instructor.

### Extensions & Late Work

Due dates for assignments will be communicated to you in advances by
your course instructor or TA. If you have questions or confusion about
due dates or grading policy, please contact your instructor promptly.

Your instructor is the final word on matters governing this course (where
not otherwise superseded by university policy.)

If you need an extension for an assignment, communicate this (in
advance) to your instructor. We will make
accommodations on a case-by-case basis. We will take into consideration
whether your request for an extension was made at the last minute (≤48
hours prior to the due date,) and we reserve the right to deny your
request for an extension in accordance with university policy.

**Late assignments will be docked a grade for each day that they are late:
an A will become an A-; an A- will become a B.**

### Absences

We expect attendance at all in-person sessions of this course.

This is an in-person course, and you are expected to attend all sessions
in-person, unless you have requested and been granted accommodations (see [below](#accommodations))

In general, absences are excused for illness, religious observation,
participation in certain university activities, or there circumstances
described in university's policy.  Since we expect the core work of what you do in this class to
be performed live in class, with your between-class assignments being about
how to improve what you have done in class, participation during course
sessions is essential to your performing well and getting the most out
of the class.  As a result, if you miss more than one class that
not covered in one of the explicitly allowed reasons for excused absences,
your grade for the class will be reduced.

It is your responsibility to inform the instructor or TA beforehand if
you will miss a class.  Students MUST communicate with their instructor or TA
regarding expected or unexpected absences.

Note that JHU policy states:

> Students should consult with their instructors and/or TAs when they
> have missed classes to explain the reasons for their absence and to
> stay on track in the course. Instructors establish their own policies
> regarding attendance, and it is the student's responsibility to know
> those policies. In certain courses, regular attendance is given
> special importance. These include foreign language courses and the
> introductory courses in the Writing Seminars and Expository Writing.
> Instructors in these courses may lower a student's grade for unexcused
> absences.
